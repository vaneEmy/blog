I am Vanessa Emily, I love programming, painting, reading and skating.<br/><br/> As I mentioned before, Programming is one of my favourites activities and I would like to summarize how all began. <br/>When I was studying at Vocacional 5, I did some projects with my friends, although it took me time to complete it. When I achieve it, it was amazing and I felt satisfied so, I decided that I wanted to create great things and also, new ones in order to help people, that is the main reason why I continue studying Computer Engineering. In addition, I gained valuable experience whilst doing my internship ar CENAC during seven months where I learnt a lot.<br/> <br/>Another thing is that I am keen on Psychology, I would love to know more about it.<br/><br/> The main purpose of writting in my blog is to share my experience and memories about these areas and sharing all the things that I am learning"
